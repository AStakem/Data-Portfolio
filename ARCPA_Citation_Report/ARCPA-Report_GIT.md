================
Andrew Stakem
2026-02-04

The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician
Assistant (ARC-PA), holds commissioner’s meetings three times each year
to review PA programs and discuss the accreditation actions to be taken
by the commission toward each program. The actions taken are published
by the commission after each meeting. The following is an analysis of
the actions taken during the era of the 5th edition standards.June
2020-September 2025.

## By The Numbers

1.  Total Number of PA Programs 2020/2025
2.  Programs Reviewed
3.  Actions Taken

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1.**

The growth of PA programs in the Unites States since June of 2020 has
been considerable. As of August 2025, 58 new programs are in operation,
a 22.3% increase. A large proportion of those new programs came into
operation between 2020 and 2022 with the growth tapering off in more
recent years. But even though the growth has slowed, new programs
continue to open at colleges and universities across the country.

\*2021 data for program growth was not available at the time of this
report

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2.**

The total number of programs reviewed by the ARC-PA Between June 2020
and June 2025 is **355**. This number includes all programs who
underwent review, this includes programs who received no citations.
Programs who underwent multiple review cycles during this period are
counted once for each cycle that was undertaken. Two review cycles = two
counts of programmatic review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3.**

The total number of citations given by the ARC-PA between June, 2020 and
September, 2025 is **2567**. This number is comprehensive of all
citations that were given and does not include actions taken such as
awarding changes in accreditation status or programs that were under
review and did not receive any citations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Analysis of the Citations

The citations administered by the ARC-PA are divided into six categories
according to the ARC-PA 5th Edition Standards. These categories include
A standards, B, C, D, E, and Portal related Standards. The following
information details the most common citations administered overall by
the ARC-PA, the top citations from year to year, and the total number of
citations given for each category of standard.

## Addendum: Maryland Specific Citation Analysis

Beginning in June 2020 through the present there have been 89 citations
levied against the six programs within the state of Maryland. These
citations are found across the spectrum of standards from the ARC-PA’s
5th edition. Most notably, the B standards are cited in the top 6 most
common citations 3 times. (Top 6 was selected due to a drop in citation
count after the 6th observation).

The citations above tell a story of struggles with student success and
learning outcomes along with procedural report or documentation related
citations. With a limited number of programs in the state being reviewed
at different stages of the accreditation cycle, the number of citations
and overall makeup of the standards that are cited can be skewed by one
program during an unfavorable review process. The standards that are
cited most (5 or 4 citations) can point to larger issues within the
Maryland PA educational community that need to be addressed as these
standards are given as citations to multiple programs in the state and
in some cases, the same program multiple times.
